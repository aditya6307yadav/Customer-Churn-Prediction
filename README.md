# Customer-Churn-Prediction 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for subscription-based services or businesses. By analyzing historical customer data, including features like usage behavior, customer demographics, and subscription history, the model identifies patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to churn. The project employs machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to create a robust predictive model capable of assisting businesses in proactively retaining customers.

The dataset is ( https://github.com/aditya6307yadav/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Churn_Modelling.csv) used for this project contains historical records of customer interactions and churn outcomes, enabling a comprehensive analysis and model training process. The project also includes an evaluation pipeline, with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score used to assess model performance. Developed in Python, the project utilizes libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and visualization. This project provides a valuable tool for businesses to enhance customer retention strategies and reduce churn rates effectively.
